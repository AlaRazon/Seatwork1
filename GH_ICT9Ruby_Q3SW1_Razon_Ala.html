                SYNOPSIS
                </h5>
                     <p>The series revolves around Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor) who in the year of 2030 tells the story to his son and daughter how he met their mother (hence the title). While living in New York City and working as an architect, the narrative deals with his best friends, including the long-lasting couple Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel) and Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan); the eccentric, womanizer-playboy Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris); and news anchor Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders). The series explores many storylines, including a love triangle between Robin, Ted, and Barney; Marshall and Lily's relationship; as well as the careers of the characters and so much more. The series is narrated by Bob Saget through flashbacks from the future.
